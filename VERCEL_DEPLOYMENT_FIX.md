# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue
Your Vercel deployment completed but shows "Skipping cache upload because no files were prepared" and the site is not accessible.

## Root Cause
Vercel didn't properly detect and build your React/Vite application. This can happen due to:
1. Incorrect project configuration in Vercel dashboard
2. Wrong root directory setting
3. Build command not being recognized

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Check Vercel Project Settings
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **General**
4. Verify these settings:

```
Framework Preset: Vite
Root Directory: crash-game-frontend
Build Command: npm run build
Output Directory: dist
Install Command: npm install
Development Command: npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables
In Vercel dashboard → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**, add:
```
BACK_URL = your-backend-url-here
```

### Step 3: Force Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
3. Make sure "Use existing Build Cache" is **unchecked**

### Step 4: Alternative - Deploy from CLI
If dashboard deployment still fails, try CLI deployment:

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm install -g vercel

# Navigate to frontend directory
cd crash-game-frontend

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

### Step 5: Verify Build Files
The CLI will ask you questions:
```
? Set up and deploy "~/crash-game-frontend"? [Y/n] Y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? [Select your account]
? Link to existing project? [Y/n] Y [if project exists] or N [for new]
? What's your project's name? rocket-crash-game-frontend
? In which directory is your code located? ./
```

## Expected Result
After fixing the configuration, you should see:
- Build logs showing successful compilation
- Assets being uploaded to Vercel
- A working URL to access your site

## Troubleshooting
If it still doesn't work:

1. **Check Build Logs**: In Vercel dashboard, click on the failed deployment to see detailed logs
2. **Verify Node Version**: Your package.json shows "type": "module", ensure Node 18+ compatibility
3. **Check Dependencies**: All dependencies should install successfully
4. **Manual Upload**: As last resort, build locally and deploy the `dist` folder manually

## Files Updated
✅ `vercel.json` - Simplified configuration  
✅ `package.json` - Added `vercel-build` script  
✅ `.vercelignore` - Proper ignore patterns  

## Quick CLI Commands
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm ci
npm run build

# Deploy with Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Check deployment status
vercel ls
```

Your local build works perfectly, so the issue is definitely in the Vercel configuration, not your code!
